# Description: HappyVirus.py is a Hackathon project created over part of a weekend. It does several
# mildly comical things such as changing the users background, creating semi-motivational files on
# the users desktop, opening happy songs on youtube, and playing harsh beeps to keep the user focused
# on the screen while this happens.
# 
# Usage: Simply run using python. To have background changing functionality work when run you must 
# have 5 files named HappyPic#.jpg where # is replaced by the numbers 1 - 5, otherwise it will just
# turn your background black.
#
# Tested with python 3.10
